                I understand the agency will provide a confidential
                comprehensive personal money management interview. I understand
                that the interview will be conducted by a certified consumer
                credit counselor or qualified professional counselor. All action
                plans, not conducted by a certified consumer credit counselor,
                will be reviewed by a certified consumer credit counselor.
            </p>
            <p class="text-25">
                I understand that by when I provide the agency with my mobile
                phone number, the agency may communicate with me via text
                message. Text message communication is not required to receive
                services from the agency. I understand that I may request
                Apprisen to discontinue sending text messages at any time.
                Message and data rates may apply.
            </p>
            <p class="text-25">
                I understand the Client Bill of Rights and Non-Discrimination
                Policy as defined on the back of this form.
            </p>
            <p class="text-25">
                I understand that in the event I am dissatisfied, I can utilize
                the Complaint Resolution Process as outlined on the back of this
                form.
            </p>
            <p class="text-25">
                I understand that most of the agency funding comes from
                voluntary contributions from creditors who participate in Debt
                Management Plans (DMP). Since creditors have a financial
                interest in being paid, most are willing to make a contribution
                to help fund this agency. These creditor contributions are
                usually calculated as a percentage of payments I make through my
                DMP – up to 15% of each payment received. However, my accounts
                with my creditors are to be credited with one hundred percent
                (100%) of the amount I pay through the agency. The agency will
                work with all my creditors regardless of whether they contribute
                to the agency.I understand that if I receive counseling relating
                to housing issues, information about my counseling session may
                be shared with funding sources for reporting and billing
                purposes. Funding sources could include the Department of
                Housing and Urban Development (HUD), the National Foundation for
                Credit Counseling (NFCC), or any State Housing Grants.I hold the
                agency, its employees, agents and volunteers harmless from any
                claim, suit, action or demand of my creditors, myself or any
                other person resulting from advice or counseling.
            </p>
            <p class="text-25">
                I understand that I will be given a written assessment outlining
                a suggested client action plan which will be based on the
                following options:
            </p>
            <ul class="text-25 ml-9">
                <li>I will handle any financial concerns on my own.</li>
                <li>
                    I may choose to enroll in the agency’s debt management plan.
                    The DMP is voluntary and serves the dual role of helping
                    clients repay debts and helping creditors to receive the
                    money owed to them.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I may choose to discharge my debt through bankruptcy. A
                    counselor may answer questions about bankruptcy, but not
                    give legal advice. If I want legal advice, I will be
                    referred for appropriate assistance. While an attorney can
                    make a recommendation to file bankruptcy, it is a personal
                    choice based on individual circumstances. I will inform the
                    agency of the decision if I file bankruptcy.
                </li>
                <li>
                    I will be referred to other services of the organization or
                    another agency or agencies as appropriate that may be able
                    to assist with particular problems that have been
                    identified.
                </li>
            </ul>

            <p class="text-25">
                I understand that I am not obligated to receive, purchase, or
                use any other services (DMP, Housing, Bankruptcy) in order to
                receive counseling. Other products/services offered by Apprisen
                may be available through other sources.
            </p>
            <p class="text-25">
                If I choose to participate in the DMP, the agency has no
                responsibility or obligation for any past, present, or future
                credit rating I receive. In certain circumstances, a DMP may
                affect my credit rating negatively. In the event that the
                counselor suggests a DMP, I will receive complete details of
                set-up and maintenance of the plan, including my
                responsibilities.
            </p>

                I understand that Apprisen may periodically share aggregated
                case file information for research and grant reporting
                requirements. All data shared in this manner is anonymous and
                has all personal identifying information removed.

                <li>
                    Step One: Try to resolve the issue with the staff member
                    involved giving him or her specific information about your
                    complaint.
