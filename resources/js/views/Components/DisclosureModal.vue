                        I understand the agency will provide a confidential
                        comprehensive personal money management interview.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that the interview will be conducted by a
                        certified consumer credit counselor.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that Consumer Credit Counseling Service of
                        the Midwest, Inc. (CCCS) does not provide bilingual
                        counseling service or professional interpreter
                        assistance to any limited English proficient clients. If
                        I require services in a language not provided by CCCS, I
                        will be referred to another approved agency that can
                        provide credit counseling in the language of my choice.
                        To find an organization that provides these services
                        please go to the US Trustee site at:

                        >.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand the Client Bill of Rights and
                        Non-Discrimination Policy as defined in the respective
                        sections below.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that in the event I am dissatisfied, I may
                        utilize the Complaint Resolution Process as outlined at
                        the end of this form.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that most of the agency funding comes from
                        voluntary contributions from creditors who participate
                        in Debt Management Plans (DMP). Since creditors have a
                        financial interest in being paid, most are willing to
                        make a contribution to help fund this agency. These
                        creditor contributions are usually calculated as a
                        percentage of payments I make through my DMP – up to 15%
                        of each payment received. However, my accounts with my
                        creditors are to be credited with one hundred percent
                        (100%) of the amount I pay through the agency. The
                        agency will work with all my creditors regardless of
                        whether they contribute to the agency. CCCS does not pay
                        or receive any other fees or consideration for the
                        referral of clients.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that the cost to me for the bankruptcy
                        pre-petition counseling session is $25 per person, based
                        on my ability to pay. If my income is under 150% of the
                        federal poverty guideline as periodically updated by the
                        U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, the course
                        is at no cost.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I give my permission to Consumer Credit Counseling
                        Service of the Midwest, Inc. to discuss and /or provide
                        any documentation needed to process my bankruptcy, to my
                        attorney of record via US mail, fax or over the phone
                        for a period of 6 months from this date of record. I
                        further understand that I may withdraw this consent any
                        time during the 6-month period.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I hold the agency, its employees, agents and volunteers
                        harmless from any claim, suit, action or demand of my
                        creditors, myself or any other person resulting from
                        advice or counseling. Nothing herein shall apply to
                        actions or claims under the provisions of the United
                        States Bankruptcy Code, 11 U.S.C. Section 101 et seq.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that I will be given a written assessment
                        outlining a suggested client action plan which will be
                        based on the following options:
                        <ol type="a">
                            <li>
                                I will handle any financial concerns on my own.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I may choose to discharge my debt through
                                bankruptcy. A counselor may answer questions
                                about bankruptcy, but not give legal advice. If
                                I want legal advice, I will be referred for
                                appropriate assistance. While an attorney can
                                make a recommendation to file bankruptcy, it is
                                a personal choice based on individual
                                circumstances. I will inform the agency of the
                                decision if I file bankruptcy.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I understand that, as one of your options, I
                                have the opportunity to negotiate an alternative
                                payment schedule with regard to each unsecured
                                consumer debt.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                I will be referred to other services of the
                                organization or another agency or agencies as
                                appropriate that may be able to assist with
                                particular problems that have been identified.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that my credit report is not impacted by
                        obtaining counseling through our agency and our agency
                        will not disclose or provide any information about this
                        counseling session to a credit reporting agency.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        In the event that the counselor suggests a DMP, I will
                        receive complete details of set-up and maintenance of
                        the plan, including my responsibilities. I understand
                        that if I choose to participate in the DMP, the agency
                        has no responsibility or obligation for any past,
                        present, or future credit rating I receive. In certain
                        circumstances, a DMP or any alternatives discussed
                        during the counseling session, including bankruptcy, may
                        affect my credit rating negatively. If I choose to file
                        bankruptcy, it will have a negative effect on my credit
                        report and credit score. Depending on the type filed, a
                        bankruptcy may remain on my credit report for 7-10
                        years.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that the agency has an obligation to
                        promptly provide me a certificate of completion within
                        one business day. I understand that I will only receive
                        a certificate if I complete the credit counseling
                        session. There is no additional fee associated with
                        generating the certificate. This certificate is valid
                        for 180 days from the date and time the counseling is
                        completed.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that CCCS is approved by the Executive
                        Office for United States Trustees to issue certificates
                        evidencing completion of a credit counseling course in
                        compliance with the Bankruptcy Code. Approval does not
                        endorse or assure the quality of CCCS’s services. The
                        United States Trustee has only reviewed CCCS’s credit
                        counseling and instructional courses as a credit
                        counseling agency pursuant to 11 U.S.C. 111(c) and has
                        neither reviewed nor approved any other services CCCS
                        provides.
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        I understand that CCCS may disclose client information
                        to the United States Trustee in connection with the
                        United States Trustee’s oversight of CCCS, or during the
                        investigation of complaints, during on-site visits, or
                        during quality of service reviews.

                    <li>
                        I understand that CCCS may periodically share aggregated
                        case file information for research and grant reporting
                        requirements. All data shared in this manner is
                        anonymous and has all personal identifying information

                    <li>
                        Step One: Try to resolve the issue with the staff member
                        involved giving him or her specific information about
                        your complaint.
